Jquery image slider that uses background images instead of html `<img>` elements.

I'm most of my projects, whenever I needed a slider on the front page, I used [Flexslider](http://flexslider.woothemes.com) but it uses `<img>` elements to make a slider. But if I wanted to add home more html content into the slider, I would have to take into account that Flexslider uses unordered lists to add images. And that complicates adding, for example a form in front of the slider. In those cases, I always had to modify the flexslider.css or even flexslider.js.

This slider makes it easy to add more content in front of the slider. You just add inside `.WhitePostSlider` block and that's it. 

Benefits:
> Easy to add more content

> Light

> Responsive


Downfalls:
> Needs to have a fixed height. Beacuse of that, it can only be used as a frontpage slider, spanning across the entire viewport height of the browser. That will be fixed in a few day or sometime next week by means of letting client code set the desired height via options.
